# Gas365 project state

## Current phase

Phase 04 — Catalog, LPG, Cylinders, Spare Parts and Inventory Ledger: implemented and locally verified on 2026-09-18; accepted on 2026-09-19 after the owner confirmed the implemented costing policy. Phase 03 checkpoint 5f4c1f9 passed GitHub Actions. Phase 05 has not started.

## Cross-chat handoff

Use [combined phase history](docs/PHASE_HISTORY.md) for the cumulative record of Phases 00–04 and the reusable new-chat prompt. Work on one numbered phase per chat according to [repository rules](AGENTS.md). Update this state, the combined history and the detailed phase report at every checkpoint.

On 2026-09-19, repository reports, Git checkpoints, source layout, costing implementation, migrations and CI configuration were reviewed to consolidate the history. This was a documentation-only handoff update; application suites and remote CI were not rerun. The owner subsequently confirmed the costing policy on 2026-09-19, closing Phase 04 acceptance; no Phase 05 work was started.

## Completed acceptance criteria

- Read the master prompt, repository rules, phase prompts and all supplied reference Markdown.
- Inspected the 47-sheet workbook structure and all 142 archived screenshots at overview resolution.
- Created the source inventory, requirement matrix, five ADRs, prioritized backlog, risk register, conventions, C4-style diagrams and explicit scope boundary.
- Recorded source contradictions and implementation gates.
- Validated maintained Markdown links, Git whitespace and staged content exclusions.
- Reviewed the Phase 00 checkpoint before starting Phase 01.
- Built the React health page, four .NET layers, PostgreSQL service, non-root Docker images and one-command local bootstrap.
- Added pinned versions, lockfiles, formatting/linting, OpenAPI, health checks, tests and baseline CI.
- Verified the empty migration baseline and explicit migration command against real PostgreSQL.
- Implemented verified-email authentication, tenant membership, branch access, role permissions, quota enforcement, session revocation and audit events.
- Verified cross-tenant endpoint isolation, composite constraints, guarded writes, live permission changes, lockout, CSRF, cookie flags and reset replay protection.
- Added responsive workspace administration and desktop/mobile email-verification/login/branch/logout journeys.
- Verified fresh and Phase 01 upgrade migrations, persistent local identity keys and local email delivery.

- Implemented Tailwind tokens, shared accessible components and a responsive application shell with permission-aware URLs.
- Added branch context, keyboard page search, dialogs, notifications and an owner component showcase.
- Verified keyboard/focus behavior, 320 px layouts, contrast tokens, axe accessibility checks and strict CSP dialog support.

## Decisions

React/TypeScript SPA/PWA; ASP.NET Core modular monolith; PostgreSQL. Initial hosting uses an application service and separate database; provider choice is open. Same-origin cookie authentication is implemented with PostgreSQL session revocation, eight-hour absolute and 30-minute idle expiry. Email links expire after one hour. Weighted-average costing applies to new transactions with immutable COGS. Posted records use reversal and replacement. Source business files remain ignored. Neutral project wording and configured contributor identity apply to commits.

## Phase 04 acceptance checkpoint

- Catalog, configurable units, LPG/cylinder definitions, spare-part categories and branch-restricted warehouses.
- Ledger-derived stock, atomic transfers, idempotency, optimistic concurrency and immutable cost snapshots.
- Optional serial assets and full reversal with dependency checks.
- Directory/detail/ledger UI, real PostgreSQL tenant/concurrency tests, migration upgrade, browser journeys and CI.

The owner selected current-date posting only, full reversals only without later affected stock movements, optional serial tracking per cylinder item, and deposits deferred to sales. On 2026-09-19 the owner approved the existing costing rules for current use: separate tenant/product/warehouse weighted-average pools across stock states, configured quantity precision up to 3 decimals (whole cylinders), cost precision of 6 decimals, PKR values of 2 decimals, midpoint rounding away from zero and full depletion consuming the remaining value. The owner may request changes in a later phase; any change must preserve posted history and document its effective scope and migration impact. Opening quantities/values must be reconciled by the operator; historical FIFO records are not imported or recosted.

## Open decisions

See [risk register](docs/RISKS.md): legal entity/name/domain; tax/invoice/FBR applicability; production hosting, protected keys, SMTP and optional MFA/phone recovery; future return valuation and real-data cutover; cylinder customer/deposit relationships; payment advances and closed-period corrections; delivery scope; subscription provider; recovery objectives and production infrastructure. Provisioning defaults of 3 active branches, 10 users and 3 administrators are local development limits pending commercial plan decisions. Keep at least one active branch; owner transfer/removal is not exposed in this phase. Tenant locale configuration beyond browser locale remains open; dates use the existing tenant time zone. Inventory uses branch context and separately authorizes both source and destination branches.

## Verification and limitations

See [Phase 04 report](docs/PHASE_04_REPORT.md) and [inventory contracts](docs/INVENTORY.md). Frontend lint, types, build and 13 component tests passed. Backend Release build, 4 unit, 4 architecture and 36 PostgreSQL/API tests passed. Sixteen desktop/mobile browser tests passed (73 tests across all suites). OpenAPI and dependency audits passed. Compose starts PostgreSQL, Mailpit, API and web after a successful migration job. Migration application, upgrade, repeatability and model-drift checks passed.

Identity/workspace tables and tenant-owned administrative endpoints now exist. Inventory implementation and technical verification are complete; purchasing, sales and payment modules have not started. The platform remains local development infrastructure, not a production deployment. Private source inputs remain ignored. Production email, encrypted shared keys, coordinated rate limits and optional MFA remain explicit gates.

Toolchain: .NET SDK 10.0.401, runtime/EF 10.0.12, Node 24.13.1, pnpm 12.4.2 and PostgreSQL 18.4. Local database port is now 54320 because Windows reserved the previous 55432 port. The template default remains configurable at 55432. Bootstrap creates a random password in ignored `.env`; API startup never applies migrations automatically.

## Exact next prompt

Phase 04 is accepted. The next prompt is **Prompt 05 — Suppliers and Purchasing** from [prompts/PHASE_PROMPTS.md](prompts/PHASE_PROMPTS.md), only when requested. Do not start it automatically.
